		<div>This combination of 5 images creates a point of reflection. It contributes to the broader collage conversations frustrations and anxiety which often develop develop in people with invisible disabilities. It also attempts to start clarifying one-sided conversations that perpetuate stigma, and delusional thought patterns to develop as a result of miscommunications.

This object also tries to, in a measured way deflect consequences of these one sided conversations that are always detrimental to all parties involved at some level. It advocates for constructive action in situations that usually trigger deep anxiety and depression in those who are marginalized by disability.

Lastly owing to this machine's usual operating control mode(i.e. remote controlled operation) it contributes wisdom to the given interactions where it is present. That is, the operator standing outside of the picture can see the whole situation and attempt to avoid making a mistake. These situations can be both physical and communications based at the same time, or be just one aspect. This aspect is one hopeful feature in the otherwise grave nature of the overall negative experiences this point of reflection depicts.</div>
		<div>The three images of myself at the three points of the triangle represent three random people who are engaged in a conversation that uses social norms that make it clear to me they are not looking to help me.

My reflection sits in the middle on the bottom next to some teeth from a piece of road construction equipment. These components contribute to the communications aspects of the roots to the depression and anxiety that can make unwelcome contributions to my life.

Further, they help to demonstrate how social situations can alienate people with invisible disabilities from families, friends and whole communities.</div>

		<div>Accessability Observation point</div>
		<div>In this observation point, this reflection of myself represents the experiences I have not enjoyed, as well as times when I have tried to make a positive contribution to society, but received an adverse reaction. An example of this part of the conversation is found below.

Michael's vision says: He has discovered he shares a great deal in common with some who have what society fails to recognize as gifts. However this reality also includes functional gaps, which can be just as traumatic if not more so than the physical handicaps that others have that are more often in the spotlight.

Michael's vision says: He thinks society places too much emphasis on relationships for pure self-gain at the expense of the benefit of society as a whole.

Michael's vision says: He hopes to find a new happiness where more systemic trust will grow relationships where just enough responsibility is taken away, so ostracizing tasks cease. These responsibilities others already enjoy, but invisible disability permits Stigma to deny this form of mutual participation to this group.</div>
		<div>I have chosen this mode of transportation to demonstrate the ways society treats people it doesn't understand for various reasons. Further, it contributes to the conversations of my collages the fact that direct experiences may produce delayed reactions that appear disproportionate to an outsider who is unfamiliar with invisible disabilities so that the outsider feels they are disproportionate to what just happened.

Stigma says: I only accept physical limitations as they are all I comprehend. I take the utmost pleasure in making life as difficult possible can for those who possess a disability, particularly an invisible one. Society what are your goals in this race for ultra marginalization?</div>
		<div>I have chosen this image collage to highlight ways society is slowly becoming more tolerant toward a population that still experiences exploitation and discrimination by others. Further, this highlights systemic inequalities in support structures that favor Visible over invisible disparities. Examples of this sort of argument in conversations appear below.

Visible disability says: Your job is to make life difficult for everyone.</div>
		<div>On the right of this image are ways society tries to make its self more equally for the visibly infirm or disabled. In the process, it puts up barriers to equal participation to those with invisible disabilities as depicted on the left.

The cut out which forms the top part of this image is a trench compactor. This is a machine for packing dirt to make hard surfaces, the front wheel (in the right of the image) is one of the actual drums of the trench compactor. This represents the function of providing hard mostly flat surfaces in public spaces for people with mobility problems. The rear wheel (in the left part of the image) should have the same function as the front wheel but you will see it is toothed and not perfectly round. This represents our failure to cater to persons with invisible disabilities.</div>
		<div>As an individual with an invisible disability, I have until recently experienced lots of indifference when I seek supports. This experience is even more frustrating to me when I see others with visible disabilities getting the supports they need. This image represents society's systemic inflexibility to the conversation. Examples are found below:

Society says: Stigma makes sure struggles of all are documented superficially, and summarily discounted after the fact. In this way, he makes the playing field more level for he who comes next. Social norms don't allow even the institutions set up to help people with disabilities to help them in all the ways that they need help.

Society says: Society thinks it has a duty to help everyone, but only ends up helping the privileged. Society takes no big responsibility for this oversight. Stigma I hope you agree with me?</div>
